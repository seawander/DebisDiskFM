The files in this folder is to make sure your MPI code of MCMC works in a Slurm cluster. 

The test example is from http://dfm.io/emcee/current/user/line/ to demonstrate the MPI capability of EMCEE with line fitting

Python scripts:
    1. ``test.py'' is a single-core calcuation of MCMC
    2. ``test_mpi.py'' is an MPI calculation of MCMC

Submit ``test.py'' with
``sbatch slurm_job_example_single_core''

Submit ``test_mpi.py'' with
``sbatch slurm_job_example_single_core''
